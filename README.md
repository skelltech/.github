# SkellTech

## Overview
Welcome to **SkellTech**, where we aim to **heal the world through technology**. SkellTech believes that our **planet is sick**, suffering from the consequences of human actions, environmental degradation, and the misuse of technological advancements.

At SkellTech, we develop **tools and applications** that reflect a vision of **restorative innovation**—addressing not just technical challenges, but social, environmental, and emotional ones as well.
